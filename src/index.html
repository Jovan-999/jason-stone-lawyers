                someone else’s negligence. Finally, the attorneys work
                collaboratively with Jason, the managing attorney, and the
                senior attorneys in the firm, to evaluate the strengths and
                weaknesses of the evidence and formulate strategies to ensure a
                successful resolution for the client.
